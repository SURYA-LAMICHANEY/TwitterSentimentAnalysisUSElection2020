Note: As a data science student who has just started learning A,B,C,D of data analytics, I was very excited when i saw this project in medium. Actually the credit for this project goes to Miss Kajal Yadav who is the original author of this project.I just wanted to learn many things so i chose to work on this project.I can assure you that i have understood each and every line of this project and have learned all the concepts used here.I even worked on another project using the concepts that i learned here.

About the project:
As the general election in US is approaching very near, people are becoming more and more enthusiatic about the result of it. Since Donald Trump and Joe Biden are contesting from their respective parties, people are not missing any chance to comment on each and everything they talk about. And what could be the best platform than Twitter to observe such activity. So in this project , the comments by the people on a tweet from each candidate is taken and analysed. This should reveal, upto some extent, so as to who is getting more love and attention from the common people and who has a higher chance of winning the election.

TOOLS USED:

1.Python — a programming language.

2.Textblob — processed textual data library tool (already trained on numerous textual data.)

3.Pandas — data manipulation and analysis library.

4.NumPy — scientific computing library.

5.Matplotlib — plotting library.

6.Plotly — plotting library.

7.Seaborn — Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

8.Wordcloud — library for a visual representation of textual data.

The project can be divided into three parts: data creation, data analysis and data visualisation.

DATA CREATION:
For this I used a software called Octoparse to download data from Twitter. It becomes very easy to extract data using this software.Two datasets are created, one for each candidate.
